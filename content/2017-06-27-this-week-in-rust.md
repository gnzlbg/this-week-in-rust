# Friends of the Forest

Our community likes to recognize people who have made outstanding contributions
to the Rust Project, its ecosystem, and its community. These people are
'friends of the forest'. The community team has been lax in making nominations for
this on a regular basis, but we hope to get back on track!

Today's featured friend of the forest is [Mark Simulacrum](https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum). As of Friday, June 23, Mark
has made sure that [all 2,634 open issues on the rust-lang/rust repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues) have a label!
Thank you, Mark, for this heroic effort!

# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [strum](https://crates.io/crates/strum), a crate that allows you to derive stringify and parse operations for your enums. Thanks to [lucab](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/lucab) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)
process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

*No RFCs were approved this week.*

## Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:

[fcp]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period

* [disposition: merge] [Experimentally add coroutines to Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2033).
* [disposition: merge] [Tiered browser support policy for Rust's web content](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1985).
* [disposition: merge] [Specify `#[repr(transparent)]`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1758).
* [disposition: merge] [Conversions from `&mut T` to `&Cell<T>`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1789).
* [disposition: merge] [Stabilize drop order](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1857).
* [disposition: postpone] [Allow `extern crate` to take a list of crates](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1875).

## New RFCs

* [Add `is_aligned` intrinsic](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2043).
* [Put the RFCs repo under license terms](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2044).
* [Allow a break not only out of `loop`, but of labelled blocks with no loop](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2046).
* [Extend Rust target specification to follow more closely LLVM triple specification](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2048).
* [Zero-Sized References](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2040).
* [`target_feature`, a necessary step towards SIMD on stable Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2045).

## Style RFCs

[Style RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs) are part of the process for deciding on style guidelines for the Rust community and defaults for [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt). The process is similar to the RFC process, but we try to reach rough consensus on issues (including a final comment period) before progressing to PRs. Just like the RFC process, all users are welcome to comment and submit RFCs. If you want to help decide what Rust code should look like, come get involved!

The RFC style is now the default style in Rustfmt - try it out and let us know what you think!

Issues in final comment period:

* [Combining openings and closings](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/61)

An interesting issue:

* [Define short](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/47)

Good first issues:

We're happy to mentor these, please reach out to us in #rust-style if you'd like to get involved

* [simple expressions](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/issues/68)

# Quote of the Week

> Regarding the C++ discussion, when I started programming the only viable oss version control system was cvs. It was horrible, but better than nothing. Then subversion was created and it was like a breath of fresh air, because it did the same thing well. Then alternatives exploded and among them git emerged as this amazing, amazing game-changer because it changed the whole approach to version control, enabling amazing things.
>
> To me, Rust is that git-like game-changer of systems programming languages because it changes the whole approach, enabling amazing things.
